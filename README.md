Some audio samples (vocal source excerpts/estimates) using "HTMD-Net: A Hybrid Masking-Denoising Approach for Monaural Singing Voice Separation".

For comparative purposes, we have also uploaded the same estimates using ConvTasNet, adapted to operate under the same conditions (mono audio - 16384 samples, sampled at 22.05 kHz).

Paper code to be made available soon. :)
